# SimpleMath
This is a simple C++ project. It will have be to twaeked slightly to run on another OS besides windows as I use a system("pause");

Basically, it uses the numbers 1-9 for 9 different variables, and doesn't repeat. It then plugs them into an equation to see if they equal your expected value. For the 9! size, it runs in about 5 milliseconds.
